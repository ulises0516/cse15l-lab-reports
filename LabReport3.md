  ## First option of grep (*grep -c*)
  ``` 
      find technical/ > find-results.txt
      grep -c "preface" find-results.txt
  ```
  **How it Works** 
  
  The first line starts searching from techincal/ and finds all the directories. 
  and "finds" the files and directoreis essentially a walking file hiearchy. The. 
  second line with the option "-c" counts the amount of lines that matches a pattern. 
  which I gave "preface" in the find-results.txt. This would output 1 as the result.
