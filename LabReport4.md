I generated an ssh key so this will not prompt me for my password :smile:.  [^1]

```cd lab7``` before continuing onto next step. This image shows the information provided after cloning. [^1]

## Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail ( step 6 )

```$ bash test.sh```

This would run the script to test the code you can also,however compile
```$ javac ListExamplesTests.java``` then ```$ java ListExamplesTests``` to show the errors of the tests.

## Edit the code file to fix the failing tests
